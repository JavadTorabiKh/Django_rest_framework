# 🌟 Django JSON API Project

Welcome to the **Django JSON API Project**! This project serves as a demonstration of my backend development skills, showcasing the ability to create a robust and efficient API using Django.


## 🚀 Features
- **RESTful API**: Seamless interaction through HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- **JSON Data Transfer**: Efficient data exchange using JSON format for lightweight communication.
- **Authentication**: Secure endpoints to protect sensitive data.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations implemented for data management.
- **Django ORM**: Utilizing Django's powerful Object-Relational Mapping for database interactions.


## 📦 Installation
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JavadTorabiKh/Django_rest_framework.git
   cd Django_rest_framework

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install Requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run Migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate

5. Start the Development Server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver


📖 Usage
Once the server is running, you can access the API endpoints through:
GET /api/items/: Retrieve a list of items.
POST /api/items/: Create a new item.
PUT /api/items/<id>/: Update an existing item.
DELETE /api/items/<id>/: Delete an item.


🔧 Technologies Used
Django: Web framework for building the API.
Django REST Framework: Toolkit for building Web APIs.
SQLite: Lightweight database for development.
Postman: Tool for testing API endpoints.


🎯 Objectives
This project aims to:
Showcase my expertise in backend development.
Demonstrate the ability to build scalable and maintainable web services.
Implement best practices in API design and data management.
